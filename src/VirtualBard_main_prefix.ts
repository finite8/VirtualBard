/*
    VirtualBard has been written primarily in typescript. This makes it much
    easier to write complex typespafe logic and even offers limited reflection
    capabilities, but makes for nigh unreadable javascript. ATTEMPTING TO MAKE
    SENSE OF SOME OF THE VOODOO CODE IT GENERATES IS AKIN TO LOOKING INTO THE
    EYES OF CUTHULU ITSELF AND FALL VICTIM TO HIS MADDENING POWERS.
    Save yourself the pain and just go to https://github.com/finite8/VirtualBard 
    for the source typescript.
